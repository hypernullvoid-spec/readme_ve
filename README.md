# Swarn — Low-Level Design (LLD) Documentation

This documentation set is a **reverse-engineered, implementation-accurate** description of the
Swarn autonomous ML-engineering agent as it exists in this repository. Every statement is
derived from reading the actual source code across the `agent/` and `swarn/` packages,
`main.py`, and `tests/`. Where behavior could not be determined from the implementation, the
docs say so explicitly.

Companion document: [../TOOLS.md](../TOOLS.md) — the user-facing catalog of all 75 agent
tools with their arguments, the `swarn` CLI, the REPL commands, and the `SWARN_*` env vars.

**Audience:** engineers joining the project who need to understand, maintain, debug, and
extend the system without first reading the entire codebase.

## Reading order

New to the project? Read in this order:

1. [00_Executive_Summary.md](00_Executive_Summary.md) — what the system is, in one page
2. [01_Repository_Structure.md](01_Repository_Structure.md) — where everything lives
3. [02_System_Architecture.md](02_System_Architecture.md) — the big picture and component map
4. [24_Multi_Agent_Runtime.md](24_Multi_Agent_Runtime.md) — the agent engine (the specialist team), then [04_Agent_Lifecycle.md](04_Agent_Lifecycle.md) for the tree search
5. [09_Tool_Execution.md](09_Tool_Execution.md) — the tool registry, the heart of the system
6. [../TOOLS.md](../TOOLS.md) — what the 104 tools actually do, and how to call them
7. [21_New_Developer_Guide.md](21_New_Developer_Guide.md) — onboarding walkthrough

## Ground rules used while writing these docs

- **Traceability:** every architectural claim cites the implementing file (and usually the
  class/function). Line numbers refer to the state of the repo at the time of writing.
- **No invention:** features that are mentioned in docstrings/READMEs but do not exist in
  code (or the reverse) are called out explicitly.
- **Versioning context:** the codebase evolved through "Phases 1–16" plus "V2"/"V3" upgrades;
  module docstrings retain that vocabulary. These docs describe the *current* code, using
  phase numbers only as cross-references to the in-code comments.
